##TASK

#First Part
The first part of the task was to read integers from user input and print them out in increasing order without repeating. We can do this suboptimally with a BST tree (it's depth could be non-logarythmical so that would mean non-logarythmical traversal of a tree).

#Second Part
The second part of the task was to modify the code used in the first half of a task to make it so that any negative integer input from a user would delete the absolute value of this integer from a tree. This of course is not as trivial but in summary we can find the
